Power BI Assignment 2

1> Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example?

ans. Natural Queries, also known as Q&A (Question and Answer), allow users to ask questions about their data using natural 
     language and get instant visualizations as results. This feature makes it easier for non-technical users to explore and
	 analyze data without having to create complex queries or visuals. An example could be a user typing "show sales by product category 
	 in a bar chart" in the Q&A box, and Power BI generating the requested visualization.

2> Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

ans. The Web Front End (WFE) cluster is a component of the Power BI Service architecture that handles user interactions and 
     requests from the web browser. It manages authentication, session management, rendering dashboards, and handling user 
	 interactions. It ensures a smooth and responsive user experience within the Power BI web interface.

3> Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

ans. The Back End cluster is the part of the Power BI Service architecture responsible for data processing, data refresh, 
     and managing datasets. It handles tasks like data transformation, compression, and storage. It also manages data refresh schedules
	 and maintains the backend infrastructure required for handling the datasets.


4> What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?

ans. In the Power BI Service Architecture, the ASP.NET component is responsible for handling authentication, authorization, 
     and other web-related functionalities. It helps secure access to Power BI content, manages user roles, and ensures proper
	 authentication mechanisms for accessing reports, dashboards, and datasets.

5> Compare Microsoft Excel and PowerBi Desktop on the following features:
   Data import
   Data transformation
   Modeling
   Reporting
   Server Deployment
   Convert Models
   Cost
   
ans. * Data Import: Both Excel and Power BI Desktop can import data from various sources, 
       but Power BI's data connectivity options are often more comprehensive and designed specifically for business intelligence scenarios.
	   
     * Data Transformation: Power BI Desktop offers more advanced data transformation capabilities, including Power Query, 
	   which allows users to clean, reshape, and combine data from different sources. Excel also has data transformation features,
 	   but Power Query is more robust.
 
     * Modeling: Power BI Desktop is designed for data modeling with features like relationships, measures, and calculated columns.
       While Excel can create models, Power BI's modeling capabilities are more optimized for BI scenarios.
	   
     * Reporting: Both tools allow for creating reports, but Power BI's visualization options, interactive features, 
	   and layout options are better suited for creating dynamic and interactive reports and dashboards.
	   
     * Server Deployment: Power BI reports can be published to the Power BI Service for easy sharing and collaboration, whereas Excel
       files often require manual distribution and may not provide the same level of online collaboration.
	   
     * Convert Models: Power BI models can be more easily converted into reports and dashboards, with optimized visuals and interactions.
       Excel models can be used for pivot tables and charts, but the transition to a full BI report might require more effort.
	   
     * Cost: Power BI Desktop is free to use, while advanced features and collaboration require a Power BI Pro or Premium license. 
	   Excel is part of the Microsoft Office suite, but some advanced BI features may require additional licensing.
