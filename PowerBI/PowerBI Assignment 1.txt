1> What do you mean by BI? Explain.

ans. Business Intelligence (BI): Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the process of collecting, analyzing, and presenting business 
     data to help organizations make informed decisions. It involves various tools, technologies, and practices that enable businesses
	 to transform raw data into meaningful insights, aiding in strategic planning, performance evaluation, and operational improvements.

2> How Power-BI helps in BI, and how does it help Analysts? Explain.

ans. Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool developed by Microsoft. It helps in BI by allowing analysts and 
     decision-makers to connect to various data sources, transform and shape data, create interactive visualizations, and share
	 insights across the organization. Power BI simplifies complex data analysis and visualization tasks, making it easier to uncover 
	 patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

3> Explain Descriptive analytics?

ans. Descriptive analytics involves analyzing historical data to gain insights into past performance and understand what
     has happened. It focuses on summarizing and presenting data to provide a clear understanding of events, often using 
	 charts, graphs, and reports.


4> Explain Predictive analytics?

ans. Predictive analytics uses historical data and statistical algorithms to make predictions about future outcomes.
     By analyzing patterns and relationships in data, predictive analytics aims to forecast trends and behaviors.
	 It helps organizations anticipate potential scenarios and make more informed decisions.


5> Explain perspective analytics?

ans. Prescriptive analytics goes beyond descriptive and predictive analytics. It not only explains what might happen in the future
     but also suggests actions to take based on the predictions. This type of analytics helps businesses optimize decisions by providing
	 recommendations for the best course of action.
