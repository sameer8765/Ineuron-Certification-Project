POWERBI ASSIGNMENT 5

1> Explain DAX.

ANS. DAX is a formula language used in Power BI (and other Microsoft products like Excel) for creating custom 
     calculations and aggregations in data models. DAX enables users to perform complex calculations and create calculated columns,
	 measures, and tables. It's designed to work with tabular data models and is used to enhance analysis capabilities within Power BI

2> Explain datasets, reports, and dashboards and how they relate to each other?

ANS. * Datasets: Datasets in Power BI are collections of related tables and data that you import or connect to from various sources. 
       Datasets serve as the foundation for creating visualizations and reports.
    
	 * Reports: Reports are interactive data visualizations created within Power BI Desktop or the Power BI Service. 
	   It consist of visuals like charts, tables, and graphs that represent insights derived from the underlying dataset.
	   
     * Dashboards: Dashboards are collections of visuals, images, and text that provide a consolidated view of data from different
    	 reports. Dashboards help users monitor key metrics and gain a high-level overview of business performance.

3> How reports can be created in power BI, explain two ways with Navigation of each.

ANS. * Power BI Desktop:

        - Launch Power BI Desktop.
        - Click on "Get Data" to import data from various sources.
        - Design visuals by dragging and dropping fields onto the canvas.
        - Add visuals, create relationships, and apply DAX calculations.
        - Save the report, and it can be published to the Power BI Service.
		
    * Power BI Service:

       - Sign in to Power BI Service.
       - Click on "Create" and select "Report" to start a new report.
       - Connect to a dataset or create a new dataset.
       - Design visuals using the visualizations pane and drag fields onto the canvas.
       - Customize visuals, add filters, and create interactions.
       - Save the report within the Power BI Service.


4> How to connect to data in Power BI? How to use the content pack to connect to google analytics? Mention the steps.

ANS. * To use a content pack to connect to Google Analytics:
       - Open Power BI Desktop.
       - Click on "Get Data" > "Services."
       - Select "Google Analytics" from the available services.
       - Authenticate with your Google Analytics account and choose the desired view.
       - Configure data loading options and load the data into Power BI.

5> How to import Local files in Power BI? Mention the Steps.

ANS. * To import local files like Excel or CSV:
       - Open Power BI Desktop.
       - Click on "Get Data" > "File."
       - Select the file type (e.g., Excel, CSV) and locate the file.
       - Choose the specific tables or sheets to import.
       - Apply transformations if needed and load the data.


6> In Power BI visualization, what are Reading View and Editing view?

ANS. * Reading View: In Reading View, viewers of the report can interact with visuals, apply filters, and explore data without making 
       changes to the report layout. It's a mode for consuming insights and exploring visualizations.
	   
     * Editing View: In Editing View, report authors or creators can modify the report layout, visuals, filters, and data connections. 
	   It's the mode where changes to the report's design and content are made
