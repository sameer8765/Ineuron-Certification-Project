1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

ANS. The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

ans. * and: Returns True if both operands are True.
     * or: Returns True if at least one operand is True.
     * not: Returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

ans. | Operand 1 | Operand 2 | and     | or      | not Operand 1 |
     |-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|
     | True      | True      | True    | True    | False         |
     | True      | False     | False   | True    | False         |
     | False     | True      | False   | True    | True          |
     | False     | False     | False   | False   | True          |


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
   
   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) = False
   not (5 > 4) = False
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) = True
   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False
   (True and True) and (True == False) = False
   (not False) or (not True) = True
   
5. What are the six comparison operators?

ans.  The six comparison operators are: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), 
      >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

ans.  The equal to operator == is used to compare two values for equality. The assignment operator = is used to assign a value
      to a variable. Example of condition: if x == 5: where you're checking if the value of x is equal to 5.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:

   spam = 0
   if spam == 10:
      print('eggs')
   if spam > 5:
     print('bacon')
   else:
     print('ham')
     print('spam')
   print('spam')
   
ans. if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')
     if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
     else:
        print('ham')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

ans. if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
     elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy')
     else:
        print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

ans. If your program is stuck in an endless loop, you can press Ctrl + C (or Command + C on macOS) to interrupt the program's execution.

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

ans. The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the continue statement is used to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

ans. There is no practical difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1). They all represent the same range of numbers from 0 to 9.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

ans. for i in range(1, 11):
        print(i)


13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

ans. import spam
     spam.bacon()
