PYTHON ASSIGNMENT - 21


1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

ans. current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")


2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string

ans.  today_string = file.read()


3. Parse the date from today_string.
 
ans. parsed_date = datetime.strptime(today_string, "%Y-%m-%d")


4. List the files in your current directory

ans. current_directory_files = os.listdir()


5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).

ans. parent_directory_files = os.listdir("..")


6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five,
   print the current time, and then exit.
   
ans. def process_function():
        import random
        import time
        from datetime import datetime

        sleep_time = random.randint(1, 5)
        time.sleep(sleep_time)
        print(f"Process finished at {datetime.now()}")

    processes = []
    for _ in range(3):
       process = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_function)
       process.start()
       processes.append(process)

    for process in processes:
       process.join()


7. Create a date object of your day of birth.

ans. birth_date = datetime(year=1996, month=5, day=15)


8. What day of the week was your day of birth?

ans. birth_day_of_week = birth_date.strftime("%A")


9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?

ans. days_to_add = 10000
     future_date = birth_date + timedelta(days=days_to_add)
