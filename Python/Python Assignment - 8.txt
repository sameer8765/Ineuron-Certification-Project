PYTHON ASSIGNMENT - 8

1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?

ans. No, the Python Standard Library is not included with PyInputPlus. The Python Standard Library refers to the collection of modules
     that come with Python by default, while PyInputPlus is an external library that needs to be installed separately.

2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?

ans.  PyInputPlus is commonly imported with the alias pypi to make it shorter and easier to use in code.
      This is a common practice to reduce the amount of typing required when calling functions from the library.

3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?

ans. inputInt() is used to take input from the user and ensures that the entered value is a valid integer. 
     inputFloat() is used to take input and ensures that the entered value is a valid floating-point number.

4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?

ans. To ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 using PyInputPlus, you can use the following code:
     import pyinputplus as pypi
     number = pypi.inputInt(prompt="Enter a number: ", min=0, max=99)


5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?

ans. The keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes in PyInputPlus allow you to specify regular expressions that define 
     patterns that are either allowed or blocked for user input. allowRegexes is a list of regular expressions that define allowed patterns,
	 while blockRegexes is a list of regular expressions that define blocked patterns.

6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?

ans. If blank input is entered three times using inputStr(limit=3), the function will raise a TimeoutException after the third attempt,
     indicating that the user exceeded the limit of allowed tries to input a value.
 
7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?

ans.  If blank input is entered three times using inputStr(limit=3, default='hello'), the function will return the default value 'hello' 
      after the third attempt. Since the default value is provided, the function won't raise a TimeoutException even if the user enters blank input.
