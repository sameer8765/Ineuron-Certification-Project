PYTHON ASSIGNMENT - 10

1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()? 

ans. * shutil.copy(src, dst): This function is used to copy a single file from the source path (src)
       to the destination path (dst).
     * shutil.copytree(src, dst): This function is used to copy an entire directory tree from the source directory (src) to the 
	   destination directory (dst), including all its subdirectories and files

2. What function is used to rename files??

ans. The function used to rename files is os.rename(src, dst). This function renames the file or directory named src to dst.


3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?

ans. The difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules is that send2trash moves files and folders to
     the system's trash or recycle bin, allowing for recovery, while shutil's delete functions like shutil.rmtree() and os.remove()
	 permanently delete files and folders, and they cannot be easily recovered.

4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent 
  to File objects’ open() method?

ans.  The ZipFile method equivalent to File objects’ open() method is ZipFile() itself. To work with a ZIP file, you create 
      a ZipFile object using the ZipFile() constructor.


5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever
   location they are in to a new folder.
   
ans. Here's a program that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (e.g., .pdf or .jpg) and copies these files to a new folder:

     import os
     import shutil

     def copy_files_by_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, extension):
         if not os.path.exists(destination_folder):
             os.makedirs(destination_folder)
    
         for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_folder):
            for file in files:
                f file.endswith(extension):
                   source_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                   destination_path = os.path.join(destination_folder, file)
                   shutil.copy2(source_path, destination_path)
                   print(f"Copying {file} to {destination_folder}")

    source_folder = "/path/to/source/folder"
    destination_folder = "/path/to/destination/folder"
    file_extension = ".pdf"  # Change this to the desired file extension

    copy_files_by_extension(source_folder, destination_folder, file_extension)
