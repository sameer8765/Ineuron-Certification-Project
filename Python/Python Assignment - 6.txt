PYTHON ASSIGNMENT - 6

1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?

ans. Escape characters are special characters that are used to represent certain actions or non-printable characters within strings. 
     They are preceded by a backslash (\). For example, \n represents a newline character, and \" represents a double quote within a double-quoted string.

2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?

ans. * \n: Represents a newline character, causing the text to move to the next line.
     * \t: Represents a tab character, causing horizontal spacing similar to pressing the Tab key.

3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?

ans. To include a literal backslash in a string, you can escape it by using a double backslash (\\).

4. The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the
   word Howl's not escaped a problem?

ans. we can enclose a string in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). If you use one type of quote to define the string,
     you can freely use the other type of quote inside the string without escaping. In this case, since the string is enclosed in double quotes,
	 the single quote within the word "Howl's" doesn't need to be escaped.

5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?

ans. use triple-quoted strings to create a multiline string. For example:
     multiline_string = '''Line 1
     Line 2
     Line 3'''


6. What are the values of the given expressions?

   'Hello, world!'[3:]  - lo, world!

7. What are the values of the following expressions?

   'Hello'.upper()             - 'HELLO'
   'Hello'.upper().isupper()   -  True

8. What are the values of the following expressions? 'Remember, remember, the fifth of July.'.split()
'-'.join('There can only one.'.split())

     * '-'.join('There can only one.'.split()) → 'There-can-only-one.'
