1. What are the different margins options and do we adjust the margins of the excel worksheet?

ans. Margins in Excel refer to the blank spaces around the edges of a printed page. They define how much space is 
     left between the contents of the worksheet and the edges of the paper when you print it.
	 Different margin options are:
	 * Normal: This is the default margin setting, providing a moderate amount of space around the content.
     * Wide: It increases the margin size, allowing more blank space around the content.
     * Narrow: It reduces the margin size, resulting in less blank space around the content.
     * Custom Margins: This option lets you manually set specific margin sizes for the top, bottom, left, and right edges.

2. Set a background for your table created.

ans. * Select the cells containing the table or click on the table to select it.
     * Go to the "Home" tab on the Excel ribbon.
     * Click on the "Fill Color" button (paint bucket icon) in the "Font" group.
     * Choose a color from the palette or click on "More Colors" to select a custom color.

3. What is freeze panes and why do we use freeze panes? Give examples.

ans. Freeze Panes in Excel allows you to keep specific rows and/or columns visible on the screen while scrolling through a large worksheet.
     This feature is useful when you have a lot of data and you want to keep headers or labels in sight, even when you scroll down or across the sheet. 


4. What are the different features available within the Freeze Panes command?

     * Freeze Panes: This option freezes both rows and columns based on the selected cell, keeping them visible while scrolling.
     * Freeze Top Row: This option freezes the top row only, so it remains visible while scrolling vertically.
     * Freeze First Column: This option freezes the leftmost column only, so it remains visible while scrolling horizontally.
