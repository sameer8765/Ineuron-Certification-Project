ans. A macro is a set of instructions or a series of actions recorded in a computer program to automate repetitive tasks. 
     In Excel, a macro is a way to automate tasks by recording a sequence of actions and then playing them back at a later time.
	 It allows users to perform complex operations with a single click, saving time and effort. 
	 Macros are useful in Excel and daily work because they streamline processes, reduce human errors, and increase productivity.

2. What is VBA? Write its full form and briefly explain why VBA is used in excel?

ans. VBA stands for Visual Basic for Applications. VBA allows users to write custom macros and automate tasks within Excel.
     It provides a way to interact with the Excel object model, which includes workbooks, worksheets, cells, charts, and other 
	 elements, to manipulate data, create user forms, and perform various actions that are not possible through standard Excel 
	 functions alone. VBA is used in Excel to extend its functionality, create customized solutions, and build powerful automation 
	 tools tailored to specific needs.

3. How do you record a macro? Write detailed steps to create a macro to automatically make the following table

     * Step 3: In the dialog box, provide a name for the macro, assign a shortcut key (optional), and choose where to store the macro

     * Step 4: Click "OK" to start recording the macro. Excel will now be in recording mode.

     * Step 5: Format the table by making it bold and adding borders as required.

     * Step 6: Once we have finished formatting the table, go back to the "View" tab and click on "Macros" again.

4. What do you mean when we say VBA Editor?

ans. VBA Editor, also known as the Visual Basic for Applications Editor, is an integrated development environment (IDE) 
     provided by Excel for creating, editing, and managing VBA code. It allows users to write, test, and debug VBA macros,
	 functions, and procedures that automate tasks in Excel.


5. Briefly describe the interface of a VBA editor? What is properties window? And what is watch window?
   How do you display these windows?
   
ans. The interface of the VBA Editor in Excel consists of various windows and components:

     * Code Window: This is where you write and edit VBA code. You can access this window by double-clicking on a module or by
       selecting a module and clicking on "View Code."

     * Project Explorer: It displays the list of open workbooks and their components, such as worksheets and modules.
       You can use it to navigate between different modules and sheets.

     * Properties Window: This window displays the properties of the currently selected object .
       You can modify the properties directly from this window.

     * Watch Window: The Watch Window allows you to monitor the value of specific variables or expressions while debugging your code.
       It helps you keep track of data during runtime.


6. What is an immediate Window and what is it used for?

ans. The Immediate Window is a useful feature in the VBA Editor that allows you to interactively test and debug code.
     It used to execute individual lines of code, query variable values, and get immediate feedback without running the entire macro or procedure. 
	 The Immediate Window is particularly helpful when you need to inspect variable values or test code snippets without modifying the actual macro.
