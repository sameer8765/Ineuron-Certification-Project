1. What are the data types used in VBA?

ans. * Numeric: Integer, Long, Single, Double, Currency
     * String: Text data
     * Date: Represents dates and times
     * Boolean: Represents True or False
     * Object: References to objects in the program
     * Variant: Can hold any data type


2. What are variables and how do you declare them in VBA? What happens if you don’t declare a variable?

ans. * Variables: Variables are used to store and manipulate data in VBA.
     * Declaration: Variables are declared using the Dim statement. For example, Dim x As Integer.
     * Importance of Declaration: If you don't declare a variable, VBA treats it as a Variant data type, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.


3. What is a range object in VBA? What is a worksheet object?

ans. * Range Object: Represents a cell, a range of cells, or a collection of cells in a worksheet.
     * Worksheet Object: Represents a worksheet within a workbook.
	 
       Both objects provide properties and methods for interacting with Excel data and formatting.


4. What is the difference between worksheet and sheet in excel?

ans. In Excel, "Worksheet" and "Sheet" are often used interchangeably, referring to a single sheet within a workbook.
     However, a "Sheet" can also refer to worksheets, chart sheets, and dialog sheets in VBA. A "Worksheet" specifically
	 refers to a sheet containing cells for data entry and calculations.


5. What is the difference between A1 reference style and R1C1 Reference style? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using R1C1
   reference style?
   
ans. A1 Reference Style: Refers to cells using column letter followed by row number (e.g., A1, B2).
     R1C1 Reference Style: Refers to cells using row number followed by column number (e.g., R1C1, R2C3).
     Advantages of R1C1 Style:
       * It's more intuitive for offsetting calculations, especially when using loops.
       * It's useful for relative cell referencing, as row and column numbers are separate.
     Disadvantages of R1C1 Style:
       * It might be less familiar to users accustomed to the A1 style.
       * Formulas in Excel cells usually use the A1 style, so R1C1 might require adjustment.


6. When is offset statement used for in VBA? Let’s suppose your current highlight cell is A1 in the below table. Using OFFSET statement, write a
   VBA code to highlight the cell with “Hello” written in it.

  A   B   C
1 25 354 362
2 36 6897 962
3 85 85 Hello
4 96 365 56
5 75 62 2662

ans. The Offset statement in VBA is used to reference a cell that's a certain number of rows and columns away from a starting cell.
     To highlight the cell with "Hello" using the Offset statement from cell A1:
	 
	 Sub HighlightHelloCell()
         Range("A1").Offset(2, 2).Value = "Hello"
     End Sub
