1. What does the dollar($) sign do?

ans. Used to create an absolute reference. When a cell reference contains a dollar sign before the column letter or row number,

     To make a reference absolute (both column and row), add a dollar sign before the column letter and row number.

     To make a reference absolute only in the column or row, add a dollar sign before the column letter or row number.
	 For example, $A1 or A$1
